We split the given train data into 10 segments, each containing 15 rows. Then we do the cross-validation: we take 9 out of 10 segments as train data, and the remaining segment as test data. We train the model on the 9 segments, and then use this model to predict the test data. This process is repeated 10 times, and each time different segment serves as test data, with remaining 9 segments serving as the train data. With the RMSE we calculate the difference between predicted Y for the test data, and given, correct values of Y. Everything explained above is repeated 5 times, each time using different lambda as a parameter for ridge regression. In the end, the RMSE-s are saved in the output file.
