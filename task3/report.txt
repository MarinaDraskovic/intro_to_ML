This task was solved by encoding the 4-character strings thanks to the sklearn One-Hot-Encoder.
This is motivated by the fact that the letters have no relations between them (A is not closer to C than to Y).
  
The resulting matrix was then fed to the standard Neural Network classifier from sklearn (MLPClassifier).
This was motivated by the ability of neural networks to capture features and do dimensionality reduction on its own.
We didn't have to specify the layers on our own, as the standard design from sklearn already gave a good margin on the baseline.
